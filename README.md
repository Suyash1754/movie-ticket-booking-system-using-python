# movie-ticket-booking-system-using-python
This is a simple movie ticket booking system implemented in Python. The system allows users to select a city, theater, movie, screen, and time to book their tickets. The system also keeps track of the number of times a user has selected a movie to ensure that they have not already made a selection.
